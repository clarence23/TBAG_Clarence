# Text-Based Adventure Game

## Introduction

- This is my Python text-based adventure game where you explore various rooms, interact with characters, and fight enemies. You can encounter friends, fight foes, and solve simple puzzles like unlocking doors. The goal is to defeat the enemies while navigating through the rooms.


## Features

- Room Exploration: Navigate through rooms like the Kitchen, Ballroom, Dining Hall, Living Room and Locked Room, each with unique descriptions.

- Character Interaction: Encounter characters like the zombie Dave, Bob the thief and the friendly Linda, engage in conversations, or fight using specific items.

- Items: Defeat enemies by using the correct item to exploit their weaknesses.

- Stealing: Attempt to steal loot from enemies only after putting them to sleep.

- Locked Room: Explore locked room and use the correct named key to unlock it. 


## How to Play

- Use commands like "north," "south," etc., to move between rooms.Each room has its own description, and some rooms are locked and require a key to enter.

  
Dave (The Zombie):

* You can fight, steal, or put him to sleep.
* Dave's weakness is 'cheese', which you need, to win a fight.
* You can temporarily put Dave to sleep using 'sleeping powder'.
* After putting him to sleep you will regain options (between fight, steal or put him to sleep again) but be at alert, you can only put him to sleep once, if you type the wrong item or same item again you will get caught!

Bob (The Thief):

* You can fight, bribe, steal, or put him to sleep.
* Bob's weakness is 'light', which you need, to win a fight.
* Again You can temporarily put Bob to sleep using 'sleeping powder'
* After putting him to sleep you will regain options (between fight, steal, bribe or put him to sleep again) but be at alert, you can only put him to sleep once, if you type the wrong item or same item again you will get caught!
* Bribe is the new option here, you can only type an amount greater or equal to Â£10 or you will get caught!

Friends:

* You can encounter friendly characters like Linda, who offer hugs or accept gifts.
* You need to give the correct gift to make them happy. (= 'flowers' in this case =)

Locked Room:

* There is a locked room that requires the 'golden key' to unlock. You need to input the correct key name to enter the room or access will be denied!

## Conclusions
- Exploration: In this new version players can continue exploring the game world even after winning battles against enemies. This encourages players to discover new areas and interact with different characters. The game finally restarts after losing or getting caught.
